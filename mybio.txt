Hi Alice Wang, my name is Marcus, but if there's another Marcus in the class and you need to get my particular attention, you can call me Marcus L.
I've been at CapU since Fall 2021. Four years after, with two term-long breaks in between, I've figured out that I would like to have geography as my academic major.
To be specific, the courses I've taken generally orbit around the subfield of 'Geographic Information Systems', where I can study both natural or social data. 
I have a particular interest in sociological philosophy with a focus on comparison and criticism. I'm also very curious about audio/visual arts and media/literary theory.  
I turned 22 on August 31st, eight days ago. I'd estimate that I've been through almost 1/4th of my life so far.
I live in Northwest Burnaby, so it takes 40 minutes for me to get to CapU's North Vancouver campus and 50 minutes back on average.
