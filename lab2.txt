1. Bob clicks on the link, prompting his internet browser application to 'enter' the link as a URL. 
2. Bob's web browser uses his device as a client device to transmit an HTTPS request to the github server computer.
3. The URL containing the github domain name is translated into the IP address of the github server device as the destination of the request.
4. The github server processes the request made by Bob's client, retrieves the data that represents the specific github repository, and sends the repository's website page code back to his device.
(NB: During steps 2 to 4, the data representing the request and the page code is encrypted in the process of communication, due to the HTTPS protocol requiring a layer of security for data transmission)
5. Bob's browser interprets the code received from the server and then renders the code into a webpage that shows the github repository.
